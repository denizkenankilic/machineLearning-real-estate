Linear and Nonlinear Models for Real Estate Data

This repository contains data analyses, linear and nonlinear modelings, machine learning codes of different real estate datasets. Folders include:

**Ames Housing:** Code is about reading and plotting the Ames Housing (xls format) data.

**Ankara Cevizlidere Home Sales:** The xlsx files of the training, the test and area&price list of all data are given. In "cevizlidereModeling.R" file there are several modeling algorithms like linear regression, MARS, random forest, neural network, SVM, decision tree,  

**Boston Housing:** We compare the rmse values of NN and linear regression of the Boston Housing data.

**Housing Data ML:** Predictions and classifications are calculated by several algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, least square regression, stepwise regression, k-nearest neighbor, k-means clustering, decision tree, AdaBoost, neural network, naive bayes and randon forest for Housing Dataset.

**San Francisco Home Sales:** In this folder there is a code to analyze and visualize the San Francisco Home Sales data.
